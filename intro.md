# Welcome to Data Structures in C++

I am in the process of creating a free resource to students who are interested in the Data Structures course. I am using C++ and Python languages as a tool to implement data structures. This book assumes that you have acquired programming skills else where.

## Who is this book for?
This book is ideal for several audiences:
- You are a computer science students and have a background in programming languages such as C++/Java/Python[^note], and wants to learn data structures in an applied manner. This book can be used as a supplmental learning resource in addition to any "conventional" text book in data structures.
- You are learning Data Science/Analytics and wants to learn how to deal with large amount of data, perform searching, addition, deletion on larger data sets with efficiency in mind.
- You are a self-taught developer and you do not have any formal Computer Science degree. You want to learn how to write an efficient and scalable code.
- You took Computer Science degree long time ago and wants to refresh your memory and learn modern algorithms.

## How to read this book?

## Feedback
This book is in the embryonic stage and there must be mistakes. I am happy to receive your feedbacks, comments, and suggestions. I look forward to hear from you.
