    "# Sorting algorithms\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we noticed the importance of Big O notations for expressing the efficiency of an algorithm. With the help of Big O notations, we managed to quantify the difference between linear and binary search algorithms. \n",
    "In this chapter, we will extend our discussion of Big O notations, include some basic sorting algorithms, and explore the efficiency of algorithms.\n",

    "In computer science, a sorting algorithm is used to sort elements of a list in order. The most frequently used orders are numerical and lexicographical. In __numerical order__, numbers are ordered in ascending or descending order. In __lexicographical order__, the letters are sorted from A-Z, an arrangement of characters, words, or numbers in alphabetical order. This is also known as dictionary order because it is similar to searching for a particular word in an actual dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the previous chapter, the binary search algorithm works on a sorted array. Therefore, without a sorted array, the binary search algorithm efficiency would not be $O(log N)$. In other words, sorting is an important step that enables some algorithms to function efficiently.\n",

    "## Real-world applications\n",
    "- Sorting is used every day in our lives. For example, financial institutions sort the accounts by name, account number, or transaction date. Likewise, the mail is sorted by postal/zip code. It is generally easier to work with a sorted list versus an unsorted list. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose that we have $N$ jobs to complete, where job $j$ requires $t_j$ seconds of processing time. We need to complete all the jobs but want to maximize customer satisfaction by minimizing the average completion time. The shortest processing time first rule, where we schedule jobs in increasing order of processing time, is known to accomplish this goal.[^opsearch].\n",

    "## Bubble sort\n",
    "It is one of the simplest sorting algorithms almost every computer science student studies. The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The {numref}`bubble_sort` shows the bubble sort in action. The elements are compared in sequence and swapped if the order is incorrect in each pass. At the end of each pass, the highest unsorted value goes to its correct position. As you see, at each pass, the single highest value gets the right order at the end of the array. During each pass, if a single swap happens, the sorting algorithm continues until no swap is performed. In this example, the fourth pass is the last/final pass, meaning there is no pass after this, and the array is sorted. If you look carefully at each pass, the number of iterations decreases by one. For example, there are four iterations at pass one, three at pass two, two at pass three, and one at pass four. Such reduction in iterations is because at each pass, a single element gets the correct position, and there is no need to compare the already sorted value, thus decrease in processing time and increasing the algorithm's efficiency.\n",

    "### Efficiency of Bubble Sort\n",
    "To quantify the efficiency of a bubble sort algorithm, I will discuss the worst-case scenario, where the array is sorted in descending order, and the goal is to sort the array in ascending order. Lets assume the ```array=[5,4,3,2,1]```. The algorithm performs two operations; compare and swap. There will be four comparisons in the given array at the first pass. Similarly, at the second pass, there will be three comparisons. In order words, the number of comparisons when $N=5$ is $(N-1)+(N-2)+(N-3)+...+1$, where $N$ is the length of an array, and $N\\geq2$. The number of swaps in the worst-case scenario is equal to the number of comparisons, which means that there is a swap operation at each comparison. {numref}`bb_sort` summarizes the number of elements in an array and the corresponding steps. If you look at the growth of steps as N increases, you will see that it is growing by approximately $N^2$.\n",

    "Let's explore another sorting algorithm, Selection Sort, and compare it with the Bubble Sort algorithm and find out which algorithm performs well.\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`selection_sort_working` shows the working of the Selection sort algorithm. In this algorithm, the lower value is identified at each pass and placed the lower value at the index 0 and onwards sequentially. For example, at the first pass, the lower value is placed at the index 0; at the second pass, the lower value is placed at the index 1, and so on. In every pass, there will be at least a comparison; however, a swap can take place either one time or none per pass. For example, the third and fourth passes have no swap. Every pass performs comparison operations for $N-i$ times, where $N$ is the array's length, and $i$ is the run counter. Based on the given example, the first run (i=1) performs 4 compare operations; the second run (i=2) performs three compare operations, and so on. See the next section for further discussion.\n",

The number of steps involved in the Selection sort to compare is $(N-1)+(N-2)+...+1$ where $N$ is the number of elements. The number of steps involved in the swap operation in the Selection sort algorithm is $N-1$. However, as discussed in the section {ref}`my-label`, the steps required to perform \"swap operations\" are the same as the \"compare operations\" in the Bubble sort algorithm. Based on the above discussion and the data shown in {numref}`s_sort`, we can conclude that the time complexity of Selection sort is about on average 1.8 of $N^2$, or $O(\\frac{N^2}{1.8})$. For simplicity reasons, the 1.8 is rounded up to 2. How 1.8 is calculated is explained in the footnote.[^ssort]\n",

However, from the eye of Big O notations, these two algorithms have the same time complexity, and there is a reason, which I will explain below.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the rules of Big O notations, the notation ignores constants and numbers that are not an exponent. For example, if you have a function running time of 5N, we say that this function runs on the order of the big O of N. This is because the constant five no longer matters as N gets large. In our case, even though the algorithm takes $\\frac{N^2}{2}$ steps, we drop the \"/ 2\" because it’s a regular number and express the efficiency as $O(N^2)$. Another example is if an algorithm takes 100N, it is still considered $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation only takes into account of higher degree polynomial. For example, if an algorithm steps follow a quadratic equation, then the big O notation will be $O(N^2)$, ignoring lower degree polynomial.

Any constant multiplies or divides with the notation does not change the linear or higher order nature of the algorithm.\n",

Still, they may have different time complexity under the best or average case scenarios. However, till now, I have mainly discussed the worst-case scenario.
