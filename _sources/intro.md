# Welcome to Data Structures in C++

I am in the process of creating a free resource for students who are interested in the Data Structures course. I am using C++ and Python languages as tools to implement data structures. This book assumes that you have acquired basic programming skills before reading the book.

## Who is this book for?
This book is ideal for several audiences:
- You are a computer science student with a background in programming languages such as C++/Java/Python[^note], and want to learn data structures appliedly. This book can be used as a supplementary learning resource in addition to any "conventional" textbook on data structures.
- You are learning Data Science/Analytics and want to learn how to deal with a large amount of data and perform searching, addition, and deletion on larger data sets with efficiency in mind.
- You are a self-taught developer and do not have a formal Computer Science degree. You want to learn how to write efficient and scalable code.
- You took a Computer Science degree long ago and want to refresh your memory and learn modern algorithms.

## Feedback
This book is in the embryonic stage, and there must be mistakes. I am happy to receive your feedback, comments, and suggestions. I look forward to hearing from you.
